Werewolf code linked with heroku app

This code for a game I'm currently working on for one of my courses. The server is currently deployed with Heroku. This is not final code.

This is the official code for my werewolf server.
Everything is hosted at http://jayyyyrwerewolf.herokuapp.com/
All that has to be run is the script aa.py
My db is being hosted at mongohq
